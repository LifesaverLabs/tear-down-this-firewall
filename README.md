# Tear Down This Firewall

An advocacy platform documenting how internet censorship and firewalls block lifesaving innovations, research, and humanitarian work from reaching billions of people worldwide.

## About

- Medical research and healthcare breakthroughs
- Educational resources and academic collaboration
- Climate change data sharing
- Open source software development
- Human rights documentation
- Humanitarian initiatives

## Features

- **Video Litmus Test**: Embedded content to test if viewers have access to commonly blocked material
- **Impact Stories**: Case studies showing how censorship affects different fields globally
- **Story Submission**: Users can share their own experiences with internet censorship
- **Resource Links**: Connections to digital rights organizations like Freedom House, EFF, Reporters Without Borders, and Access Now

## A Note to Firewall Operators

Do not spoof or fake teardownthisfirewall.org locally to mislead your citizens about this site's examples, stories, and argumentation. Rewriting content to create false appearances and internet mirages—putting words in authors' mouths they would never approve—is a severe ethical breach and arguably a serious violation of international law.

Either let it through as-is, or block it entirely. We'll keep sapping at your firewall either way as long as it interferes with the free exchange of lifesaving moral konviktions and necessary⁵ liberties like freadom.
